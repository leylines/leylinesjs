# Migration guide
Going from a 7.x.x TerriaJS to 8.0.0 and beyond

## Deprecations

There are a few features in v7 that we are considering deprecating, we’ll have more on this in the near future — some of these include:

* ABS ITT
* Socrata(?)
* WMS region mapping

Reach out to us if you are using these, we only know about the things we have seen.
